## 💼 Highlighted Projects

The `Web Portfolio Programs/` folder contains Python scripts used in the site’s *Projects* section. Each project is designed to show beginner-to-intermediate AI and automation skills:

- **Chatbot 2.0** – remembers user input, mood, and gives motivational replies  
- **Stock Predictor** – uses `yFinance` and logistic regression to predict trends  
- **Weather App** – pulls real-time data via weather API  
- **Joke Bot** – fetches and prints random jokes from an online API  
- **Price Predictor** – house price estimation using regression  
- **Urdu Quote Bot** – rotates inspirational Urdu quotes  
- **Productivity Bot** – quotes, timer, and productivity features  

Each project includes:
- Clean and commented Python code  
- Real-world utility or logic  
- GitHub link for previewing source  

## 🧪 How to Run the Site Locally

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Ensure you’re connected to the internet to load Google Fonts and AOS scripts  
4. To preview chatbot logic, open developer tools to see console logs  
5. All Python projects can be tested separately via terminal or IDE (like VS Code)  

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add real contact form backend (e.g. EmailJS or Formspree)  
- Improve chatbot logic with LLM API integration  
- Add project filters and pagination  
- Transition to React or Flask for scalability
